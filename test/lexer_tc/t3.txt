% Test Case 3: Edge cases with comments, tricky real/integer numbers, and odd spacing

% A line that starts with comment and never ends...
% This entire line should be treated as a comment by a well-behaved lexer

%% Double-percent? Possibly unexpected if lexer only looks for single '%'

_main      % This should still parse as an identifier token TK_MAIN (keyword if in your grammar)
    input parameter list [ int    c1   ] output   [ real c2  ] 
;

% Check integers with leading zeros and large integers
000123   9999999999999999999999999999   <- c1 ; 


% Real numbers with multiple decimal points, exponents, signs:
% below main bt hai
0. .234  12. .0e+5   23.45E+  23.456E+10  12.3400E-03
12.34E++10  % Possibly malformed exponent (should break or cause a lexer error)

c2 <---  -123.456E+7;   % Valid assignment if your syntax allows negative sign
c2 <---  +456.78.99;    % Should break the lexer or be recognized as erroneous real token
c2 <---  .5;            % Real with no leading digit

% Check the operator tokens (all relational, logical, etc.)
if c2 >= 10 &&& c2 != 100 || c2 <= 900 ~ c2 ~ < c2 <> c2 @@@ c2
    then
        write(c2);
    endif
